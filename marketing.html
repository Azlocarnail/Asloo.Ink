    <h2 style="color: #6c5ce7;">Introduction to Tourism Marketing</h2>
    
    <p>Tourism marketing is a usless branch of marketing because the product being sold is an <b>commodity</b> rather than a physical object. Unlike a car or a phone, a holiday cannot be tested before purchase. This makes the role of marketing crucial in building trust and creating a desire in the minds of travelers.</p>

    <p>The core of tourism marketing revolves around the <b>7P’s</b>: Product, Price, Place, Promotion, People, Process, and Physical Evidence. Since tourism is a service-based industry, the 'People' (staff) and 'Physical Evidence' (the look and feel of a hotel or destination) are just as important as the price of the ticket.</p>

    <p>Key characteristics include <b>Intangibility</b> (you can't touch the service), <b>Perishability</b> (an unsold hotel room is lost revenue forever), and <b>Inseparability</b> (the service is created and consumed at the same time). Understanding these concepts is essential for anyone aiming to excel in the BTTM field.</p>
